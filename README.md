## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Finally understood the Position concepts, as I had to apply them on the hover function for the main card image.

In this case, I had to use Position Absolute in order to use the element stacking.

### Continued development

CSS positioning concepts.

### Useful resources

- [Absolute Centering in CSS
  ](https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/absolute-centering-in-css-ea3a9d0ad72e) - This helped me on positioning hover items over the main image.
